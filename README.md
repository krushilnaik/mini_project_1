## Summary
This was just a small project to get us familiar with pulling data from third-party APIs and manipulating them with Python, namely the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.

This pulls latest stock values from Yahoo! Finances for a set of 5 companies (Apple, Disney, Tesla, Corsair, and Microsoft) and generates PNG graphs of them.

To the stock fanatics out there: I am not one. Don't put too much thought into my terminology or you will cringe.

## Usage

Just navigate to the root directory of this project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by `python ./main.py`

NOTE: This assumes you have some variant of Python 3 already installed.
